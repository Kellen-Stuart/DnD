Features to strive for
    - Random monster encounter based on party level
    - Ability to update the state of monsters per turn
    - Admin override
        - if there's a bug in the application,
            you'd want to be able to manually override

Things that are missing
    - State - things need to be stored in a database
    - Interface to apply damage to a specific monster
    - Expose the "Take Damage" Method
    - Create a "Select Action -> Do Damage" Method
    - Create a "Status of Monster" Method
