# Overview
A Blazor web application to recreate the mechanics of DnD. 

# Why?
DnD calculations are costly and time consuming. 
Wouldn't it be nice if there was an easier way? 
The idea is to have the DM control the "Admin" portion of the app.
The Players can login to the app and see current status and update certain things.11
This would essentially get rid of having a pen and paper to keep track of all your calculations.11

# Current State of the Project
[11/16/2019]
Currently, this is just an excuse for me to learn Blazor and expand my GitHub profile.
This project is still in development and is completely unusable at the moment.
If this project picks up enough steam, perhaps we can make it fully-fledged :).
